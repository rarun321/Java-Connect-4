Connect4 AI:
All three AI's use a scoring system to predict players next move. The better probability a column has the better chance it will win.
The algorithim uses recursion and each level has a different depth that the recursion reaches. This makes it so the ai will only see a certain amount
into the future to predict the players next move.
