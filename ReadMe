Easy:
This algorithm uses a random number generator to generete one of three spots.
The spots are a range from where the previous token was placed.
The spots can either ben on the sides or on top.

Medium:
This algorithm uses a scoring system to predict the best move for the ai based on the previous moves.
It only uses three scores.

Hard:
This algorithm uses a scoring system to predict the best move for the ai based on the previous moves.
It only only uses five scores.
I will eventually change this to a recursive function which will test all possibilities and will make a move based on future moves that could be made.
